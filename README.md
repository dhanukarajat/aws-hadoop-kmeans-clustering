# aws-hadoop-kmeans-clustering
Running Hadoop on Amazon EC2, k-means clustering and visualizing results using Pandas library

- Created and configured an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance with Hadoop to perform map-reduce on large data-sets comprising of million tuples. 

- Created and deployed a python web application on AWS which provides users to upload big data-sets online and perform analysis upon it and view results online. Once the analysis is completed, clustering is performed upon the map-reduce output. 

- Users can choose the number of mappers, reducers and clusters to perform the analysis. Then the clustered output data is visualized using scatter charts and bar charts and displayed online according to user's choice of axis.
